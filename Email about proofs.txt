Slightly revised version (no change of actual content).  Note that (K2) and (K3') are very similar; they share common conditions.  Can we combine them?

--------- Proposal --------------------

* Replace bogus (IG2) with a new unrelated (IG2') that
  embodies completeness
    (IG2') for every (b -f-> s) in S, S*(f, s) /= b
  That is, no element of S can be rewritten to Refl by S
  If there was such an element, we will just discard it.

  Looking at Example 2, notice that (IG2') is false of this set
    a -W-> b
    b -G-> a
  So we must kick out the Wanted, as desired

* Replace the old (K3) with (K3'):
  Recall that the work item is: a -fw-> t
  (K3') For every (b -fs-> s) in S, b /= a
        (K3'a) s is not a type variable
     or (K3'b) t /= b
     or (K2'c) fs >= fw         c.f. K2b
     or (K3'd) not (fw >= fs)   c.f. K2c

  NB: we can't insist the that inert is of form
    b -fs-> a, because of Example 3


Claim: The main theorem holds assumming (IG1, IG2'), (T1-3), (K1-2), (K3')
       and proving (IG1), (IG2') of the extended substitition


NB: a simpler story is to kick out all Wanteds when you add a Given
When adding a -fw-> t, kick out (b -fs-> s) unless
   not (fw >= fs) or (fs >= fw)

--------- Examples --------------------

Example 1

   work-item   b -G-> a
   inert-item  b -W-> a

Then we kick out the inert item by K1, and all is good

------------------
Example 2: completeness

   work-item   b -G-> a
   inert-item  a -W-> b

Here we must kick out the inert item to get completeness,
becuase it will then rewrite to a~a and be solved by Refl.
This is not covered by (K1) or (K2)

-----------------
Example 3: a more complicated variant of Example 2

  Work item: b -G-> a

  Inert:     a -W-> d
             d -G-> b

Must kick out the wanted:

  work item: a -W-> d
  inerts:    b -G-> a
             d -G-> b

Now we can rewrite the work item to Refl.

----------------
Example 4: Kenny's example

  Work list:  c -G-> a
  work item:  b -G-> c
  inert:      a -G-> b

If we kick out the inert, and
put the work item in work list:

  Work list:  a -G-> b
  work item:  c -G-> a
  inert:      b -G-> c

LOOP!
